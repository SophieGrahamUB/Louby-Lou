For 25 years I’ve been spreading giggles, Joy and Fun all around the North West! Clowning isn’t easy, if it wasn’t for my 3 wonderful girls I would have surely burnt out by now. What does make being a Clown easier however, is being able to witness smiling parents, giggling children and above all sharing and creating memories that will last a lifetime! Since the ripe old age of 6, I’ve been developing my skills within the entertainment business, perfecting the recipe for the perfect celebration! It starts with a base of good old-fashioned clown skills, laced with a generous dose of modern Ibiza dance tunes and a dash of the unexpected! A true recipe for Excitement!",
